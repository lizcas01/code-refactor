# Code Refactor
## Description
For this project, we took existing code and rewrote it make the file look cleaner and most importantly, to make the webpage more accessible. My motivation for this project was to improve my coding skills in order to put them to use in the future and learn from anything that I possbily might've missed. By working on this project, I learned that crticial thinking skills are important to decide which elements or attributes are best to use. I also realized that CSS files require more work than I initially thought.
